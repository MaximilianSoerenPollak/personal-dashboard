## What is this about? 

This project is about building a personal dashboard and learning GO while I do it.
The dashboard is suppose to show me all important information and be rather adaptible to my needs.


## What did you want to accomplish with this project?

With this project I want to acomplish a couple of things.  
The main reason for this project is that I want to learn a new language.   
I have choosen GO for this. It seems like a good and usefull language for my job and "easy" to learn  
for a first "typed" language. So this is the reason behind choosing GO.  
The second reason is that I wanted to have a "Welcome" screen where all important information for me is displayed.  
So, I'm going to pack both things into one and code this project in GO to learn the language and do the project as well.  

Another but smaller reason is that I want to learn how to plan and structure projects better.  
This hopefully will also help with that.  

## What should this project do?

The project should be a dashboard where I can see everything that is important to me at a glance.  
Here are some ideas that I want to implement. I'm not sure what is actually usefull of that list.  

- Calendar with todays itinerary.  
- Current Stock values from different Depots
- Todays TO-DO list
- 3D print time (left) / with camera.
- Package Tracking
- Emails
- Current Information about my Server
    - Disk Usage
    - Internet Speed Up/Down
    - How many people have accessed it
    - What services on it are running or not

As said I will have to take a closer look of which of these makes sense, these are just some ideas for now.  

I want to have the backend be an API and the Dashboard maybe with Graphana (not sure yet).  
Doing the backend with an API will give me easy expandability to new functions (just add new routes).  

## What do you want to include in an MVP? 

The MVP should consist of two things.
- API backend.
- One graph in the dashboard.
- *Edit* CLI to interact with the API / request the dashboard.

I want to have a working API that can give me up to date (if necessary) data for the single chart I will have in the Dashboard.  

I'm not sure which Graph this will be yet, still have to figure that out.

## Will there be other "iterations" than the MVP?

There might be other "stepping stones" in some of the implementations. For example I maybe need to make an itteration  
on the "Stock" dashboard, since the API's necessary for that are with OPEN BANKING API's which I have not yet taken a deep  
look at but seem rather complicated.  So I might do these with CSV ingestion first as oppose to integrate the Banks API's.  

Other ones that might need a couple of steps to reach maturity maybe the Calendar.

I'm sure I will itterate a lot of things often since I'm learning the language completly from scratch. So the more I  
know the more I will want to re-write the old code I cobbled together sometime past. But that is future talk.


## How long do you expect this to take?

I honestly have no idea. Since I've recently started a new Job that will take a lot of brain power to learn a lot of new things.  
I hope I can get meaningful progress in this project since as said above it is a way to learn GO for me, and that I'm rather excited about.  
So no strict timeline or deadline but I do hope to make constant (if probably slow) progress.  

*Update*: I have now finished the very basics of learning the GO syntax and will now start with building the API.
I'm guessing this will be a much harder step than learning basic syntax but I'm excited to find out if that is the case.


## What if I find something that is horribly done in this code?

Please by all means, if you find something that is horribly done, let me know what it is and how to do it better.  
I would also be very appreciative if you would tell me why that is a horrible implementation.


## Roadmap

- [x] Write the first README outlining the project
- [x] Learn basic GO syntax
- [ ] Write the API
- [ ] Implement first Dashboard-Chart
